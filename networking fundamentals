SSL/TLS Works with TCP

SSL & TLS - encryption protocols that sit on top of TCP, provide confidentiality, integrity and authentication for data transmitted
TCP handles reliable delivery while SSL/TLS handles secure encryption of that data

-> SSL/TLS HANDSHAKE
  - client send Hello message 
  - server responds with hello
  - Server certificate is generated
  - Keys are exchanged
  - Symmetric encryption is achieved

-> TCP - Transmission Control Prototcol
- ensures reliable, ordered and error checked delivery over a network
- packet loss doesnt happen

-> TCP 3-Way Handshake 
-> TCP Conection States
-> TCP FLAGS


-> OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnection

application - 
presentation - 
session - 

transport -  converts packets to segments

network - responsible for routing packets transmitted through routers, converting frame to packets

data link - responsible for node to node delivery , converting bit to frame

physical - transmits raw bits over physical media
