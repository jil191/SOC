SSL/TLS Works with TCP

SSL & TLS - encryption protocols that sit on top of TCP, provide confidentiality, integrity and authentication for data transmitted
TCP handles reliable delivery while SSL/TLS handles secure encryption of that data

-> SSL/TLS HANDSHAKE

-> TCP - Transmission Control Prototcol
- ensures reliable, ordered and error checked delivery over a network
- packet loss doesnt happen

-> TCP 3-Way Handshake 
-> TCP Conection States
-> TCP FLAGS



-> OSI Model

application - 
presentation
session 
transport -  

network - responsible for routing packets transmitted through routers

data link - responsible for node to node delivery 

physical - transmits raw bits over physical media
